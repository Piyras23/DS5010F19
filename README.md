## TextBook
There is no formal required text book for this course, but the following book may be helpful to give you a solid knowledge of programming with Python.

- Learning Python. Mark Lutz. O'Reilly Media, 2013.

## Reading
I will post links to some articles which cover the topics that we discuss in class.

## Grading
Grades will be based on finger exercises (20%), programming assignments (40%), midterm (20%), and final (20%).

## Finger Exercises (FE)
After each session, students have to complete all the challenges that are included in a linked HackerRank contest. These challenges are mostly simple problems which cover the topics we have discussed in a session, and usually they can be solved with a few lines of code.

The FE challenges will be graded in a binary fasion. You get the total score for a challenge if you are able to pass all the test cases, or otherwise you'll get 0 for that challenge.

## Programming Assignments  (PA)
We have total of 5 programming assignments. The problems that you will solve in these assignments need more time and effort to complete and solve.

## House Competitions (HC)
Registered students are divided into ? houses (?). Every other weekend, we will have a programming contest. At the end of semester all the members of the house that on average performed better than other houses in the contests will get the following prize:

- Their final letter grade will go up one step. For example, if you are a member of the winner house, and you got **B+** at the end of semester, your grade will be passed as **A**.

Also the individual who performes the best between others in the competitions, will get a $50 cash prize at the end of semester :D

## Course Policy
- We will not take attendance in class. You can skip any sessions that you think you already are well familiar with the topics that are going to be covered. As the quizes are online, if you skip the class, you have to do the quiz in its specified time. The link to quizes will be posted online.
- You can search the internet as much as you want, even during contests and exams! This is what you will do in real world, and it is my responsibility to not give you something which is easily accessible online!
- You can collaborate with any of your house members. But you **CANNOT** submit a same code for FEs and PAs (but you can do that for HCs)! In other words, you can talk about ideas, but each student should do the implementations by themselves.

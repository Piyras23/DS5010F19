## TextBook
There is no formal required textbook for this course, but the following book may be helpful to give you a solid knowledge of programming with Python.

- Learning Python. Mark Lutz. O'Reilly Media, 2013.

## Reading
I will post links to some articles which cover the topics that we discuss in class [here](readings.md).

## Grading
Grades will be based on finger exercises (20%), programming assignments (40%), midterm (20%), final (20%).

## HackerRank
Most of the exercises and assignments for this course are given as [HackerRank](http://hackerrank.com) challenges. You should sign up in hackerrank with a username that **I will** give to you. 

## Finger Exercises (FE)
During each session, we will try to practice what we have learned by doing a number of challenges that are included in a linked HackerRank contest. Usually these challenges can be solved with a few lines of code. If we cannot complete all the challenges in a session, the students have to do the rest after the class.

The FE challenges will be graded in a binary fashion. You get the total score for a challenge if you are able to pass all of its test cases, otherwise you'll get a 0 for that challenge.

## Programming Assignments  (PA)
We have a total of 5 programming assignments. The problems that you will solve in these assignments need more time and effort to complete and solve. You will hand-in your PAs through HackerRank contests as well.

## House Competitions (HC)
Registered students are divided into 5 houses (Stark, Baratheon, Lannister, Targaryen, and Martell), and each students should have gotten an alias name which is a famous character name from Game of Thrones!! Approximately every other weekend, we will have a programming contest. At the end of the semester all the members of the house that on average performed better than the other houses in the contests will get the following prize:

- Their final letter grade will go a level up. For example, if you are a member of the winner house, and you've gotten **B+**, then your grade will be passed as **A-**.

Also the individual who wins the iron throne (first place with respect to the average rank in all the competitions), will get a prize üèÜ  which will be announced later.

## Course Policy
- We will not take attendance in class. You can skip any sessions that you think you already are well familiar with the topics that are going to be covered.
- You can search the internet as much as you want, even during contests and exams! This is what you will do in the real world, and it is my responsibility to not give you something which is easily accessible online!
- You can collaborate with any of your house members. But you **CANNOT** submit the same code for FEs and PAs (but you can do that for HCs)! In other words, you can talk about ideas, but each student should do the implementations by themselves.
- The deadlines are strict. No late submissions will be accepted.
- Participating in House Competitions is not mandatory.
